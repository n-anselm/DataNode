### GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com) is *the* place to store all of your coding projects! It is probably the best version control system out there. Even with a free account, you can have unlimited repositories and collaborators.

### Stackoverflow

Got a question, problem, or stuck? [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) has the answer most of the time. This is an incredibly useful site for devs, sysadmins, and other people.
