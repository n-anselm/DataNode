### Welcome to DataNode!

This repo's purpose is to provide information on programming, networking, Linux, hacking, and tech in general. I am planning to add a lot of content yet.

**DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WAY IN WHICH YOU USE THIS INFORMATION. USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

*NOTE: The files were created with a program called Obsidian; therefore, some things might not display correctly here on GitHub. If you want to try it out, Obsidian is an excellent app and is compatible with Linux, Windows, and MacOS.*
