### Welcome to DataNode!

This repo's purpose is to provide information on programming, networking, Linux, hacking, and tech in general. A lot of content will be added yet.

*NOTE: The files were created with a program called Obsidian; therefore, some things might not display correctly here on GitHub. If you want to try it out, Obsidian is an excellent app and is compatible with Linux, Windows, and MacOS.*
