# Mycroft AI
Mycroft AI is the world's first open source voice assistant.

### Installing Mycroft AI
You can install it with Snap:

	snap install mycroft --beta

or you can install it via git:

	git clone https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-core.git
	cd mycroft-core
	bash dev_setup.sh

### Setup
To run Mycroft, use the following commands:

	cd ~/mycroft-core
	./start-mycroft.sh debug

To stop Mycroft:

	/stop-mycroft.sh

After installing Mycroft, you will have to create a Mycroft account and add your Linux machine to your devices for the assistant to work properly. Simply head to the [Devices section of the Mycroft website](https://account.mycroft.ai/devices) and hit “Add Device.”

Mycroft will provide you with an activation code to enter. Enter the code and then you’ll be ready to start using Mycroft.

### Using Mycroft AI
Mycroft is fairly advanced, and you can do things like ask it to play the news or ask it to set a timer. Mycroft is speech-based, so you won’t have to worry about entering commands. For example, if you wanted to set a timer for five minutes, you literally just have to say “Set a timer for five minutes.” Mycroft will detect your speech and then get your timer started.

Mycroft is pretty good at converting speech to text, and I didn’t experience any major problems with it understanding me.

You can stop Mycroft by saying “_Hey Mycroft stop_.” You can even add additional skills to Mycroft. For example, you can add things like an audio recorder skill and a reminder skill. It is a much more advanced platform than Betty and is always learning, so it will continue to get better.

Mycroft is a refreshing open-source AI virtual assistant. The company even sells hardware smart speakers that have functionality similar to devices like the Amazon Echo.
