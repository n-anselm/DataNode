In general, there are three different types of proxies: **transparent proxies**, **anonymous proxies**, and **elite proxies**.

---

- **Transparent proxies** don't hide your real IP address. They may seem useless at first glance, but they are helpful for passign by local firewalls that may block access or slow down your connection.

---

- **Anonymous proxies** hide your real IP address. This means that your actual location is not visible when you use an anonymous proxy. This type of proxy is great for anonymity, but sacrifices speed. Additionally, some sites may have firewalls that can detect those using anonymous proxies.

---

- **Elite proxies** have the advantages of anonymous proxies with an additional benefit. They help you conceal using a proxy at all, so they are not stopped by any firewalls. However, because they provide complete privacy, they are typically slower due to frequent reloads.
